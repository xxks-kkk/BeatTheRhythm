    ///     another example of how ScoreFlashRendererBase can be implemented.

    ///     rendering techniques, though ... so maybe there is some use
    ///     case for this ... it's up to you ;-)
    ///     Please let me know if you need a version of this that supports
    ///     high density displays (it's not hard but as I don't really see
    ///     use cases for this ATM, it wouldn't be worth the time to
    ///     implement it).
