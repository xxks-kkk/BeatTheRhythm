# BeatTheRhythm

A music game for Android/iOS/PC

This project is still under development. The main content of the game is *PLAYABLE* but still need polish. Currently, I am working on the port to make it playable without use of Unity.
## Installation

Make sure you have Unity installed on the computer. Pull the project and run the scene named "lvl1" in the Unity.
