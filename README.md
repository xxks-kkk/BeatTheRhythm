# BeatTheRhythm

A music game for Android/iOS/PC

This project is still under development. The main content of the game is *PLAYABLE* but still need polish. Currently, I am working on the port to make it playable without use of Unity.

**NOTICE**: Due to the size of project, I zipped latest version of the project and uploaded it to cloud drive:

http://yunpan.cn/cwW4qNNDI2eUr (fetch code: elephant flies 5 times in 1 day)

I am trying to move all the files onto the github but it may take a while. So, if you want to try now, please download the zip file from drive and follow the installation guide below. Sorry for the inconvenience :(

## Installation

Make sure you have Unity installed on the computer. Pull the project and run the scene named "lvl1" in the Unity.
